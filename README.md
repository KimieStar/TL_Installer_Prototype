### Automatic

You can choose either to enter nothing and just continue which will install everything in the Downloads folder. Or by choosing a path where to install it everything will be installed in the specified folder. Example of how the path should look like `"C:\Users\<Your Username>\Downloads\"`.

## Update
- After you choose 'Update' you will be asked to enter a path of your 'Temmie Launcher' installation. It would look like something like this `"C:\Users\<Your Username>\Downloads\Temmie Launcher"`. Once you enter it the updater will check for any updates and if any are available it will update your 'Temmie Launcher'.
